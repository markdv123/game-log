### :video_game: Overview :video_game:

This app serves as a social media site for gamers to record and share their experiences with specific video games. Users can make posts detailing their views about a game, including a personal rating, image, and description. Like other social media sites, fellow users will be able to comment on these posts. Being able to consolidate one's play history and opinions could be beneficial to twitch streamers and game hobbyists who wish to share their recommendations effectively.
